Perfect timing 😃
If you’re putting this project on GitHub, your **README.md** is the first thing people will see. It should:

1. Introduce the project (what it is, why it’s useful).
2. Show how to install & run.
3. Explain features clearly.
4. Add screenshots (optional, but helps a lot).
5. Mention tech stack + credits.

Here’s a clean draft you can drop in as `README.md`:

# 🎬 MovieSense – AI Movie Recommendation System

MovieSense is a **content-based movie recommender system** built with Python and Streamlit.  
It helps users discover movies based on **titles, genres, or release years**, using **TF-IDF vectorization** and **cosine similarity**.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 🔍 **Search by Title** – Enter part of a movie name and get similar recommendations.  
- 🎭 **Search by Genre** – Type genres like `action`, `romance`, or `comedy` (supports fuzzy matching).  
- 📅 **Search by Year** – Get all movies released in a specific year.  
- 🎞️ **Posters Included** – Shows poster images if available in dataset.  
- ⭐ **Deduplication** – Removes duplicate titles, keeps the highest-rated version.  
- 📊 **Dataset Viewer** – Browse and download the cleaned dataset directly.  

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Python 3.8+**  
- **Streamlit** – Interactive web app framework  
- **Pandas** – Data handling  
- **scikit-learn** – TF-IDF vectorizer + cosine similarity  
- **difflib + regex** – Fuzzy search for genres and titles

## ⚙️ Installation & Usage

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash

   cd MovieSense
````

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the app**

   ```bash
   streamlit run movie_app.py
   ```

4. Open your browser at:

## 📸 Screenshots (Optional)

*Add a few screenshots of the app here (Home page, Recommendation page, Dataset page).*

## 📖 How it Works

1. The dataset is cleaned and preprocessed (movie title, genre, year, rating, poster).
2. A **TF-IDF vectorizer** converts text into numerical vectors.
3. **Cosine similarity** compares movies based on combined metadata (title, genre, overview).
4. User input is matched:

   * If input is a **year** → filter movies from that year.
   * If input is a **genre** → recommend movies in that genre.
   * If input is a **title** → find the most similar movies.
5. Results are displayed as **cards with posters, genre, year, and ratings**.

## 🙌 Credits

* Dataset: 500+ real movie entries with posters.
* Built with [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) & [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/).

👉 Question for you: Do you also want me to **generate a `requirements.txt`** file for your repo (so installation is one command)? That’ll make your GitHub project more professional.
